# Rust WebGL Experiment

Essentially following [rustwasm](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/main/examples/webgl)'s example guide, and building on top of it.

# Development

To start, run

```bash
npm run
```

To install node packages required. Next, run

```bash
cargo build

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in the browser.
